At this stage, the basic functions of the application and how it will work will be developed step by step.

Expenditure date, amount and category information will be entered.

-Expenditure analysis by categories:
A system will be established that analyzes the categories in which users' spending is concentrated (e.g. creating graphs using Matplotlib).
